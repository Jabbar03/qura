# TODO

## Design

### Circuits

 - [x] Decide how to represent circuits, circuits with input and circuit-building computations. (Done: as in the paper)
 - [x] Decide how programs are meant to be executed: from a starting circuit or standalone. Consequently, choose whether $Q$ should appear in the implementation of the language type system or not. (Done: the former)
