# PQ Language Reference

PQ is a domain-specific functional programming language for the description of quantum circuits. It features a rich type system, which allows for the specification of resource requirements in a program's type. This is made possible thanks to several advanced typing constructs, such as:

- [Linear types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substructural_type_system#Linear_type_systems),
- [Type refinements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinement_type),
- [Effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_system),
- [Closure types](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-45221-5_47).

A detailed documentation of PQ is still in the works. For the time being, we refer users to the [research paper that first introduced Proto-Quipper-RA](https://doi.org/10.1145/3704883), the theoretical precursor of PQ.
